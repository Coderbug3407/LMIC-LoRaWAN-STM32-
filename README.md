This project utilizes an STM32F303 board and a LoRa RF95W 915MHz module for data transmission. Leveraging the LMIC LoRaWAN Library, it connect to The Things Network Server, a pivotal element in LoRaWAN solutions.


🔑**PROBLEM**

In this project, I simply uplink data from the end node device that utilize the ARM STM32F303 Nucleo and the LoRa RFM95W 915MHz Module.
That using the IBM LMIC Library class A. By the way, I also write the documentation that guide how to config LoRaWAN named "LoRaWAN Configutation Guide". It integrated with The Things Network Server.

📢**NOTE**
In the document, I write detailed about peripherals, hardware description, STM32 and the SPI protocol and how to create account or connect end devices.
